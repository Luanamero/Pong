# Pong

This is a simple Pong game made in C with [Raylib](https://www.raylib.com/), where two players must play agains each other (not possible to play against the computer).

The game uses Finite State Machine with three states:
- Serve: a player needs needs to press ENTER key to start playing;
- Game: the actual gameplay;
- End: congrats the winner and offers to restart the game.
